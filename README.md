# BlogEngine
This is a school coursework.The project includes ASP.NET Core back-end and React front-end for a blog engine. The repository also contains documentation in Russian (I don't think it's really necessary to add it in English).

# API
You can find API documentation in [APIDOCS.md](https://github.com/potyoma/BlogEngine/blob/main/APIDOCS.md). Webapi is available [here](https://blog-engine-api.herokuapp.com).

# Web app (Blazor)
You can find working web app [here](https://blazor-blog-client.vercel.app/).
There is a problem with routing. You can't navigate via URL to any page except main. Sorry, I'm working on it.
