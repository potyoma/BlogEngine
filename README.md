# BlogEngine
This is a school coursework.The project includes ASP.NET Core back-end and React front-end for a blog engine. The repository also contains documentation in Russian (I don't think it's really necessary to add it in English).

# API
You can find API documentation in APIDOCS.md. Webapi is available [here](https://blog-engine-api.herokuapp.com).
